# The Stand

Ward-scoped web application for preparing, conducting, publishing,
and recording sacrament meetings.

This repository contains full build, architecture, security,
deployment, and operational documentation.

Core Principles:
- Ward isolation enforced at DB (RLS) and API layer
- Supplements (never replaces) official Church systems
- Public program pages are read-only published snapshots
- Support Admin bootstrap with secure random password
- Production-ready deployment guidance included
